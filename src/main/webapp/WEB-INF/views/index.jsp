            <p class="lead mb-5">Since my university days, I have been passionate about programming and creating software solutions.
                It was during my studies that I took my first voluntary course of programming thermal and flow phenomena.
                This experience opened my eyes to the possibilities of coding and software development.
                I later took Java from Scratch course and gained valuable knowledge and experience on Java, OOP, SQL, Hibernate and Spring.
                </p>

            <p class="lead mb-5">Now, I am determined to pursue a career as a Junior Java Developer. I am excited to take on new challenges,
                learn from experienced developers, and contribute to the creation of innovative software solutions.
                I am committed to continuing to expand my knowledge and skills, and I believe that a career in Java development is the perfect way to do so.</p>

            <p class="lead mb-5">I would like to invite you to my GitHub profile where you will find the code behind this CV I created using the Spring framework.
